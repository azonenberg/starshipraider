# Intro

TODO: talk more about the project

# Project Codenames

Boards, subsystems, etc are all named after famous electrical engineers.

## General

* STARSHIPRAIDER: umbrella term for the entire project
* CLARKE (Edith Clarke, first female EE professor in USA): the original STARSHIPRAIDER project

## Oscilloscopes

Individual instrument projects are named after famous electrical engineers who made major contributions to the field of
test equipment design.

All are 8 channels.

* BLONDEL (Andre-Eugene Blondel, inventor of electromechanical oscillograph) \
  8 bit: 100 MHz / 250 - 500 - 1000 Msps \
  12 bit: 50 MHz / 125 - 250 - 500 Msps \
  4 AFE : 1 HMCAD1520 \
  Two acquisition cards, 4 channels each \
  One XC7A100T-2FGG676 on main board \
  One DDR3 800 SODIMM on main board

* DUDDELL (William Duddell, inventor of moving-coil mirror oscillograph) \
  250 MHz / 1 Gsps, 1 AFE : 1 HMCAD1520

* ZENNECK (Jonathan Zenneck, inventor of electrically scanned CRT oscilloscope) \
  500 MHz / 4 Gsps, 1 AFE : 4 HMCAD1520

* VOLLUM (Howard Vollum, co-inventor of triggered-sweep oscilloscope) \
  1-2 GHz / 10 Gsps, 1 AFE : 1 AD9213

* MURDOCK (Melvin Jack Murdock, co-inventor of triggered-sweep oscilloscope) \
  6 GHz / 40 Gsps, 1 AFE : 4 AD9213

## Probes / peripherals

* CONWAY (VLSI pioneer, co-author of Mead & Conway) \
  8-bit comparator-to-LVDS logic analyzer pod with SFF-8087 interface and high-impedance inputs

* MEAD (other half of Mead & Conway) \
  8-bit comparator-to-LVDS logic analyzer pod with SFF-8087 interface and 50 ohm inputs

* MAXWELL (James Clerk Maxwell, discovered Maxwell's Equations) \
  Kintex-7 ISERDESE2 based LA

* TODO: Artix-7 GTP based LA??

* DENNARD (Robert Dennard, inventor of DRAM) \
  Kintex-7 GTX based LA

* BRAUN (Karl Ferdinand Braun, inventor of optically scanned CRT oscilloscope and phased array)
  Low-bandwidth active probe
	ADA4817-1ACPZ-R7

* HALL (discovered Hall effect)
  AKL-PT1 passive probe
