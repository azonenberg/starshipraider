\section{Safety Information}

To avoid personal injury, damage to the probe, or damage to the attached instrument, it is important to understand and
follow the warnings and specification limits in this document.

\begin{itemize}
\item Only personnel familiar with the safe use and operation of electronic test equipment should use this probe.
\item Do not connect the ground terminal of this probe to any voltage other than earth ground.
\item Do not exceed operating limits in the specifications section of this document.
\item The soldermask on this probe is \emph{not} rated for insulation against hazardous voltages, and conductive
elements are exposed at the tip and connector. Do not use this probe on any circuits which may contain voltages
exceeding 30 Vrms, or the touch-safe voltage limit in your organization's standard operating procedures if this is
lower.
\item Do not operate in damp or wet conditions, or under temperature/humidity extremes in which condensation is
likely.
\item Do not operate this probe in a flammable or explosive atmosphere.
\item Wear eye protection and ensure good ventilation when soldering.
\item The SMPM connector center terminal is made from beryllium copper (BeCu) alloy. While exposure to beryllium is
expected to be insignificant during ordinary use of this product as the BeCu is in solid form and covered by gold
plating, hazardous dust could potentially be generated if the contact material is ground or abraded.

CA PROP 65 WARNING: This product can expose you to beryllium, which is known to the State of California to cause cancer.

\section{Theory of Operation}

Tha AKL-PT5 probe is a \emph{transmission line probe} and works very differently from high-impedance passive or active
probes many engineers are familiar with. It is intended primarily for probing relatively low impedance ($50 \Omega$),
high bandwidth digital signals, which ordinarily require expensive active probes to properly examine.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=4cm]{schematic.png}
\caption{Simplified probe schematic}
\label{schematic}
\end{figure}

The signal is split off from the DUT at the point of contact and travels through a $450\Omega$ resistor at the probe
tip. A distributed element filter applies a low-pass response to compensate for parasitic capacitance of the tip
resistor, which would otherwise create undesired peaking. It then travels on $50\Omega$ transmission line through a
SMPM connector and coaxial cable to the oscilloscope, which terminates the signal with $50\Omega$ to ground.

The tip resistor and termination form a 10:1 voltage divider, so the oscilloscope sees the incident signal attenuated
by a factor of 10 (-20 dB). \emph{Note that a $50 \Omega$ termination at the instrument is required. This probe cannot
be used with lower-cost oscilloscopes that only have $1M \Omega$ terminations.}

The tip resistor and scope-side termination in series present a total loading of $500 \Omega$ on the DUT. While this is
a significantly lower DC impedance than conventional probes, the resistive input stage has extremely flat frequency
characteristics with much less capacitance than conventional passive probes. This means that the impedance of the probe
remains comparatively constant across the entire operating range, rather than greatly decreasing at higher frequencies.

\pagebreak

\section{Usage Instructions}

Proper soldering and desoldering technique is crucial to getting the best performance and lifetime from your probe.

\subsection{Probe Coupling}

Transmission line probes such as the AKL-PT5 have significantly higher DC loading than a the common $10M\Omega$ passive
R-C divider probe, and may interact poorly with pull-up/pull-down resistors or level shifters with automatic direction
sensing. Consider AC coupling (using an industry standard SMA inner DC block before the scope input), or use of a
different type of probe for these applications.

\subsection{Test Point Design}

The probe tip leads are flexible and can mate with signal and ground contacts at arbitrary spacing from 0 to 8mm. The
natural spacing of signal and ground contacts, requiring the least amount of bending of the leads, is 2.0 mm.

Avoid placing test points in confined spaces between components or in other difficult-to-reach locations. The probe PCB
is nominally 5.6 mm wide so a minimum width of 6.0 mm is suggested for a free fit allowing for PCB routing tolerances.
Sufficient clearance around the signal and ground contacts for hand soldering must be provided, taking into account the
location of the probe PCB itself.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Placing and Securing}

\subsubsection{Site Selection and Optimal Placement}

Determine which side of the test point you intend for the probe to approach from and ensure a good ground point is
easily reachable, removing solder mask if necessary.

If your probe is configured with the ground lead on the wrong side\footnote{For convenience, the AKL-PT5 is available
with one of two ground lead placements from the factory, to the left (AKL-PT5L) or right (AKL-PT5R) of the signal
contact as seen with the SMPM connector facing upward. The PCB is identical for both SKUs, and a probe can be easily
swapped between configurations in the field with a soldering iron.} of the signal contact, desolder it and reattach it
to the opposite footprint.

The probe should approach the test point from a fairly steep angle: a 45 to 60 degree angle from horizontal usually
works well. This minimizes coupling between the tip leads/resistor and signals or ground planes on the DUT, which can
introduce crosstalk to measurements or degrade bandwidth. Avoid placing the probe body or leads parallel to the board
whenever possible.

\subsubsection{Mounting the Probe Head}

The probe leads are fragile and not intended to be load bearing. When working with any solder-in probe, it is critical
to provide a firm mechanical attachment \emph{before} soldering the tip. Securing a probe operating at microwave
frequencies, such as the AKL-PT5, requires additional care to avoid degrading the performance of the system.

The AKL-PT5 contains an integrated mounting fixture consisting of an 0.5 inch (12.7 mm) square FR4 ``foot" and a 2.1
inch (55 mm) length of 20 AWG (0.81mm) insulated solid copper wire, attached to each other and the probe head with
SAC305 solder. To mount the probe, begin by selecting a suitable location for the mounting foot, typically about 1 inch
(25 mm) from the test point. The upper surfaces of ICs or connectors are often good locations for the foot, as seen in
Fig. \ref{placement}.

Select a piece of double-sided tape and attach one side of the tape to the underside of the mounting foot. The AKL-PT5
ships with sample quantities of two different types of tape: a clear acrylic elastomer and a white polyurethane foam.
For information on ordering additional tape, see the \hyperref[ordering-info]{Ordering Information} section.

Both tapes may be removed from the probe and DUT without damage or leaving residue if appropriate care is exercised,
however the white foam tape provides significantly greater holding force when attached to typical PCB materials. It is
typically used for longer term, semi-permanent measurements; the clear tape has a weaker adhesive and may be preferable
for shorter term use when the probe is expected to be frequently repositioned.

Hold the foot in place and place the probe head close to the test point to check the fit. Adjust the mount as needed so
that the leads are floating a short distance (roughly the thickness of the probe PCB) above the test point, accounting
for the thickness of the mounting tape.

Remove the liner from the tape and secure the foot to the desired location.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{placement.jpg}
\caption{AKL-PT5 probe mounted to DUT with double-sided adhesive square and ready to solder.
Note placement of mounting foot on connector.}
\label{placement}
\end{figure}

\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Attaching and Securing the Cable}

Once you are satisfied with the placement, if the probe head and cable are not already attached, connect the SMPM cable
to the probe head by grasping the cable connector and probe PCB firmly and pressing the connectors straight into each
other, as shown in Fig. \ref{smpm-mating}. You may hear or feel a slight click when the connector seats fully, but this
may not be noticeable in every case.

Make sure to hold the probe by the edges to avoid exerting force on the leads. Do not twist or rotate the connectors
during or after mating.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{smpm-mating.jpg}
\caption{Connecting the probe and cable.}
\label{smpm-mating}
\end{figure}

CAUTION: DO NOT attempt to mate or unmate the SMPM connector once the probe is soldered to the DUT. This is very likely
to result in the probe moving enough to damage the test point, probe, or both. Always mate the connector prior to
soldering, and desolder the probe prior to unmating.

The coaxial cable attached to the probe should also be secured to prevent applying excessive force to the probe body,
as the mounting wire is too flexible to resist a significant tug on the cable without the probe head moving. Any method
providing adequate mechanical support while respecting the minimum bend radius of the cable (0.1 inch / 2.54 mm) may be
used.

For a small DUT it may be necessary to either loop the cable back over the board before taping it down (see example
setup using polyimide tape in Fig. \ref{cable-secured}) or tape both the DUT and cable to the bench. Leave sufficient
slack at the probe end of the cable to allow motion during soldering, and to act as a strain relief in case the main
length of the cable is accidentally bumped or tugged.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{cable-tape.jpg}
\caption{Securing cable to DUT with polyimide tape}
\label{cable-secured}
\end{figure}

\FloatBarrier

\subsection{Soldering}

Once the mounting foot is secured to the DUT and the mounting wire is bent correctly, the signal and ground leads
should be floating just above the test point. Use tweezers to pre-bend the signal and ground leads so that the tips are
correctly spaced for your test points. The probe body should be roughly centered between the signal and ground points
so that both leads bend approximately the same amount. The goal is for the springiness of the mounting wire to hold the
leads under very slight tension once soldered - just enough to keep them taut, but not enough to place significant
force on the solder joints.

Remove soldermask from the signal and ground test points with a scraper if necessary, and tin the points with a fine
point soldering iron.

Apply a small amount of flux to the ground test point. Manipulate the probe body with one hand while holding the
soldering iron in the other. Gently move the probe body to press the ground lead against the tinned test point, then
melt the solder to form the joint. Do not tug directly on the ground lead with tweezers as this places significant
stress on it.

Ensure the solder solidifies fully before letting go of the probe. (Soldering the ground point before the signal point
helps reduce mechanical stresses on the DUT signal traces, which are typically smaller and less mechanically robust
than large ground planes or bypass capacitor pads.)

Apply flux to the signal test point, then use tweezers to position the signal lead against the tinned test point and
solder it. Inspect the joints as necessary. Remove excess flux after soldering using isopropyl alcohol on a lint-free
swab.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{tip-soldered.jpg}
\caption{AKL-PT5 tip soldered to test point}
\label{tip-on-testpoint}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

\subsection{Desoldering}

Use a soldering iron to melt the solder on the signal contact, then gently nudge the probe tip wire to one side with
tweezers. Desolder the ground lead after the signal lead is free of the DUT, holding the probe body or mounting wire
with your other hand to prevent it from moving suddenly as the solder melts.

Remove any excess solder from the tip leads and test points with desoldering braid.

After desoldering is complete, gently peel the mounting foot off the DUT and discard the used adhesive pad. The clear
tape's adhesive has a lower peel strength and should not require any special techniques to remove; the white tape is
significantly stronger and requires more effort to remove. It may be necessary to apply some prying force at a corner
of the foot-to-tape joint with a spudger or similar tool. Once the probe is free of the tape, the tape on the DUT
should come free easily by peeling from one corner, without leaving behind any residue on the probe or DUT.

To unmate the cable from the probe, grasp the probe head by the edges between two fingers with one hand while holding
the SMPM connector of the cable between two fingers of the other hand and pull them apart with a slight rocking motion.
Do not apply any force to the coaxial cable or heat shrink tubing as these are not designed to handle significant
tensile loads. You may be able to get a better grip on the cable connector by using your fingernails to pull the front
face of the connector away from the probe (Fig. \ref{smpm-unmating})

\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

\subsection{Maintenance and Repair}

\subsubsection{Replacing the Mounting Wire}

The mounting wire is considered to be a consumable and is expected to eventually fail from repeated
bending over the lifetime of the probe. The mounting wire may be easily replaced with a new piece of
wire by hand soldering when this happens, or if a longer, shorter, stiffer, or more flexible mount is preferred. The
factory-supplied mounting wire is a 2.1 inch (55 mm) length of 20 AWG (0.81mm) insulated solid copper.

The solder joint connecting the mounting wire to the underside of the probe head is covered by a peelable blue
polyurethane mask (Dymax E-MAX 906-B or similar) to reduce the risk of accidentally short-circuiting the DUT. This mask
may be easily peeled away with tweezers to enable desoldering of the mounting wire. Once a new mounting wire is
installed, flux residue should be removed and the solder joint re-covered with an insulative material. Electrical tape,
polyimide tape, or a similar peelable maskant are all acceptable for this purpose.

\subsubsection{Replacing the Tip Resistor or Ground Lead}

The tip resistor and ground lead are expected to fail over time from repeated bending and soldering cycles. The ground
lead may also need to be moved from one side to the other in order to fit a particular DUT.

TODO: talk about details of parts and procedure

\subsection{Cleaning and Storage}

To avoid attracting dust or corroding the tip contacts, when the probe is being stored it is best to remove flux
residue from the tip area. This may be done with isopropyl alcohol and a lint-free swab, or any other industry-standard
flux remover suitable for the flux in question.

The SMA connector on the supplied cable is gaged before shipment to ensure the pin and dielectric position are within
tolerance, however it is good practice to gage the connector periodically to detect any gradual misalignments as the
connector wears.

The probe should be stored in the provided foam-lined cardboard box when not in use to protect the fragile tip contacts
from mechanical damage. The foam and cardboard are static dissipative to ensure ESD safety and prevent charges from
building up on the probe which could damage surrounding equipment, however the probe itself has no active components
and is relatively insensitive to ESD.

\FloatBarrier
\subsection{Cables}

The AKL-PT5 must be connected to the host instrument via a $50 \Omega$ coaxial cable terminated with a SMPM female
connector at the probe side. Highly flexible cabling, such as 0.047" / 1.19mm micro coax, is preferred for mechanical
reasons despite having higher loss than larger cables: thicker flexible cables are much stiffer and springier, and
unless perfectly straight are likely to apply significant forces to the solder joints.

The stock cable supplied with the probe kit is Koaxis part number AO10-KF047-RO10-36.00-MC-TD,
and comes with individually serialized S-parameters for de-embedding. Longer or shorter cables using the same KF047
cable stock, or using a connector other than SMA at the instrument end, may be ordered directly from Koaxis if required
for your application.

For specialized applications requiring very low loss, consider use of hand formable cables. Although they have limited
lifetime, their relative lack of springiness once bent allows thicker cabling to be used without applying excessive
force to the probe.

The cable should be taped to a lab bench or the DUT as shown in Fig. \ref{cable-secured}, or otherwise secured to
prevent transferring any force into the probe.

Values in this section are typical / limit values. For measured values from a specific probe, please consult your
calibration certificate.

\subsection{Absolute Maximum Ratings}

Exceeding these limits may result in permanent damage to the probe. Ratings in this section are stress ratings only and
normal operation at these limits is not implied.

\end{tabularx}

ENGINEERING NOTE: The sustained current/voltage limits are thermally limited and based on the 50 mW power rating of the
$200 \Omega$ tip resistors. Brief pulses or low duty cycle waveforms whose average power does not exceed these limits
\emph{may} be possible to probe safely with the AKL-PT5 as long as tip voltage does not exceed the instantaneous
voltage limit at any time, however Antikernel Labs has not performed any testing of the probe under pulsed load
conditions. Use of the probe with instantaneous power levels exceeding the thermal limits will void the warranty and
customer assumes all risk of harm to personnel and equipment resulting from such usage.

\subsection{Cable}

The cable supplied in the AKL-PT5 accessory kit is 36 inches in length, SMA straight plug (m) to SMPM straight plug
(f), and made from Koaxis KF047 0.047" coaxial cable. Cables are individually serialized and include S-parameters to
26.5 GHz.

For specialized applications, cables of other lengths or with different scope-side connectors may be ordered directly
from Koaxis. Antikernel Labs recommends using only KF047 cable or equivalent highly flexible micro coax with the
