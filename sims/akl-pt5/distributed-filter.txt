150 um track = 83.1 ohms
1mm track = 28.1 ohms
1.5mm track = 20.5 ohms

w @ 8 GHz = 8e9 * 2 * pi = 50.25e9 rad/sec
S21 phase for 8mm long 1.5mm track is 128.6 degrees = 16.075 deg/mm

C1
	C = w * C * Zlow
	With 1.5mm wide track, 22.79 deg = 1.41 mm long

L1
	L = w * L / Zhigh
	with 150um wide track, 11.63 degrees = 0.723 mm

L2
	L = 75.94 deg = 4.72 mm
	have to fit in ~1.8 x 1.8 mm
